There are many different versions of the Blackjack rules around.

Below are explained the most common rule variations.

## H17 vs S17

### H17 (Hit on Soft 17):

- More common in many casinos across the U.S., especially in larger
  gambling hubs like Vegas and Atlantic City.

- This rule benefits the casino because it increases the house edge by
  approximately 0.22% compared to S17.

- Often found in tables with lower minimum bets and in multi-deck
  games.

- Casinos sometimes offset this increased edge by offering other
  player-friendly rules (e.g. fewer restrictive doubling rules).

### S17 (Stand on Soft 17):

- Common in European casinos.

- Less common in the U.S. but still present, particularly in
  high-limit rooms or at premium tables where the house edge is
  reduced to attract more skilled or high-stakes players.

- This rule is more player-friendly and typically found in single-deck
  or double-deck games.

- Often paired with higher minimum bets and stricter rules on doubling
  down or splitting.

## Dealer peek

Dealer peek is a rule in blackjack that affects how the dealer handles
certain situations when their upcard is an Ace or a 10-value card. It
determines whether the dealer checks for blackjack before players
continue their actions.

The dealer peek is a standard practice in most American casinos but
not in Europe.

### When the Dealer Peeks:

- If the dealer has blackjack, the game ends immediately, and all
  player bets lose (except insurance bets or player blackjacks, which
  push).

- If the dealer does not have blackjack, the game continues as usual,
  and players take their turns.

### Impact on the House Edge:

- The dealer peek rule is advantageous for players because it prevents
  losing additional bets (such as doubles or splits) if the dealer
  already has blackjack.

## Surrender

Late Surrender and Early Surrender are two blackjack rules that allow
players to forfeit their hand and recover part of their bet, reducing
losses in unfavorable situations.

### Late surrender

- Players are allowed to surrender their hand and forfeit half their
  bet, but only after the dealer has checked for a blackjack.

- Common in the U.S. casinos.

### Early Surrender

- Players are allowed to surrender their hand and forfeit half their
  bet before the dealer checks for blackjack.

- Rare in the U.S. but more common in European casinos.
